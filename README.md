# Markdownfier for ChatGPT

## What is this plugin

When using ChatGPT with Obsidian, you might find that the output format isn't standard Markdown â€” such as equations being in LaTeX format â€” which can affect the readability of your documents. This plugin does exactly what its name suggests: it formats ChatGPT's output into Markdown and removes any empty lines.
